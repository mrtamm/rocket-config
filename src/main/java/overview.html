  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Rocket-Config</em> aims to provide a simple but customizable configuration file format and a reusable but simple
    parsing mechanism (without handling file-lookup). The configuration file format is borrowed from the Unix world
    where settings are divided into sections. A section begins with its name (surrounded by square brackets) on a single
    line. The lines following the section name line are treated as section settings data until next section name or end
    of file is reached. Here is an example:
  </p>

  <pre class="demo">
# This is a comment

[general]
name    = HelloWorld
url     = https://www.example.org/
timeout = 10000

[entities]
org.example.entity.User
org.example.entity.UserGroup
org.example.entity.Widget

[filters ]
# contains no filters
</pre>

  <p>
    Each <em>section</em> data block may have its own syntax format, however, a line in a section usually denotes
    exactly one setting value (one value, therefore, usually cannot span multiple lines). There are two settings
    representation formats for sections:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>name-value pairs</strong> (separated by equals sign) as <code>java.util.Map</code> entries (the
      <code>[general]</code> section in previous example);
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a list of values</strong> (one value per line) as <code>java.util.List</code> items or an array of items
      (the <code>[entities]</code> section in previous example).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A configuration file should therefore consist of one or more sections where each of them has a unique name and a
    custom setting representation rules. There are two built-in approaches to parsing and storing settings from a
    configuration file:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><em>A single configuration object per file</em>: the parsed data is stored in the specified configuration bean
      (section data will be stored as soon as entire section is parsed) and each section handles part of the targeted
      bean (each section can have its own custom settings format).</li>
    <li><em>Multiple configuration objects per file</em>: all sections are expected to contain key-value pairs of
      settings and the data will be stored in a bean per section (the bean type is the same for all sections). Section
      names are not predefined but they must not be empty; the result of parsing is a map where section names from the
      file become keys and corresponding values will be instances of beans configured with the settings in the section.
  </ol>

  <p>The previous example requires a single configuration object because it contains sections with different modes.</p>

  <p><strong>Comment</strong> symbol is <code>#</code> &ndash; everything after <code>#</code> till the end of line is
    ignored by the stream reader.</p>

  <p><strong>Whitespace treatment</strong> depends on the section reader, which handles all the lines between a section
      name line and the following section name line (or the end of file). The built-in readers follow these rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>a configuration file may contain as many blank lines as needed since they are ignored;</li>
    <li>whitespace at the beginning and at the end of a line with value are trimmed;</li>
    <li>whitespace around equals-sign (map key-value) is trimmed;</li>
    <li>whitespace around section name in square brackets is ignored;</li>
    <li>both Unix and Windows line breaks are supported no matter in which system the library is deployed;</li>
    <li>note: there is no escape character so that a line could be continued on the next line; each actual line is
      treated individually.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>All in all, <em>Rocket-Config</em> library provides the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A configuration model for describing the expected configuration file;</li>
    <li>Parsing the configuration file data right into a created instance of the predefined Java bean;</li>
    <li>Elementary validation of the correctness of both configuration model and file;</li>
    <li>Errors and warnings gathered from validation and parsing</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This should help application writers to simplify the process of custom configuration file format creation and
    parsing, too. In addition, as the data is immediately stored in runtime bean, it's a better guarantee that the data
    from a file will convert to target runtime type. Besides, the configuration bean can also be used programmatically,
    too.</p>

  <p>Besides what this library can do, there are tasks that it <em>does not deal</em> with:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>configuration file lookup and location preferences &ndash; it's easier to let each application handle it;</li>
    <li>configuration semantic correctness &ndash; the configuration object can implement checks in setter methods or
      better provide a separate validation method to call after a configuration file has been parsed.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="depend">Dependencies</h3>

  <p>
    <em>Rocket-Config</em> library is binary compatible with <em>Java 1.6</em> and newer Java VMs. No other external
    dependencies are needed.

  </p>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage Guide</h2>

  <p>
    As mentioned, there is file-based and section-based configuration object data parsing. They are handled separately.
    So let's look at file to one configuration object parsing first.
  </p>

  <h3 id="usage-single">Single Configuration Object per File</h3>

  <p>The <a href="ws/rocket/config/ConfigModel.html"><code>ws.rocket.config.ConfigModel</code></a> class takes care of
    the most that anyone usually needs. It provides a builder for setting up a model, immediately validates the model,
    and reading data from a configuration stream to a runtime bean.</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p>

  <pre class="demo">
ConfigModel&lt;AcmeConfig&gt; model = ConfigModel.expect(AcmeConfig.class)
    .section("general").ofMap().storeIn("name", "url", "timeout")
    .section("entities").ofList(Class.class).storeIn("entities")
    .section("filters").ofList(Filter.class).storeIn("filters")
    .ready();

AcmeConfig conf = model.parse(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/acme.conf"));
conf.validate(); // Custom validation done by the configuration bean.
</pre>

  <p>
    The previous example expects a configuration file with three sections: <code>[general]</code>,
    <code>[entities]</code>, and <code>[filters]</code>. The sections in the file must have same order but may skip any
    of them to use default settings of the section. This example also defines that section <code>[general]</code>
    expects key-value pairs (<code>ofMap</code>) and stores the values of settings <code>name</code>, <code>url</code>,
    and <code>timeout</code> in corresponding properties of <code>AcmeConfig</code> class (<code>storeIn</code>). The
    target runtime type of these properties will be determined by corresponding bean setter method argument types.
  </p>

  <p>The second section ("entities") is a list or array of class names (<code>ofList(Class.class)</code>) to be
    converted into <code>java.lang.Class</code> instances and to be stored in property "entities" of an
    <code>AcmeConfig</code> instance. Whether <code>Class[]</code> or <code>java.util.List&lt;Class&gt;</code> will be
    stored in the instance, depends on the setter method parameter type (however, <code>List</code> is attempted first).
  </p>

  <p>
    The third and last section ("filters") is a also a list or array of class names to be converted into runtime
    instances that must extend or implement the custom type <code>Filter</code>. The data will be stored in the property
    of an <code>AcmeConfig</code> instance using either <code>public void setFilters(Filter[])</code> or
    <code>public void setFilters(java.util.List&lt;Filter&gt;)</code> method.
  </p>

  <p>The sample configuration from the introduction can be parsed by the model created here.</p>

  <h3 id="usage-map">A Configuration Object per Section</h3>

  <p>
    A configuration file can also define multiple objects of same type, each with its own settings. For example, let's
    imagine there is file describing all data-sources that an application could use:
  </p>

  <pre class="demo">
 # This is a comment
[products]
url      = jdbc:derby:products
username = test-app
password = kopd901e21
timeout  = 10000

[users]
url      = jdbc:derby:users
username = test-app
password = 4542dsapd3
timeout  = 10000

[warehouse]
url      = jdbc:derby:warehouse
username = test-app
password = sdvfowpd2
timeout  = 10000
</pre>

  <p>
    This data can be stored in a <code>java.util.Map</code> where section name is key, and the parsed data-source is the
    value. Here's a way to do that:
  </p>

  <pre class="demo">
MapConfigModel&lt;AcmeDataSource&gt; model = MapConfigModel.expect(
    AcmeDataSource.class, "url", "username", "password", "timeout");

Map&lt;String, AcmeDataSource&gt; data = model.parse(
    getClass().getResourceAsStream("/datasources.conf"));

// Custom initialization:
for (AcmeDataSource ds : data.values()) {
    ds.init();
}
</pre>

  <p>
    The important part to remember is the first two lines:
    <a href="ws/rocket/config/MapConfigModel.html"><code>ws.rocket.config.MapConfigModel</code></a> class is used this
    time, and available setting names are defined right after the expected configuration class.
  </p>

  <p>
    This model first attempts to call a constructor with the specified parameters (in same order) where the values are
    taken from the map of parsed name-value pairs. When that fails for any reason, it attempts to create instance using
    default constructor and write properties by the setting name when its value has been provided.
  </p>

  <p>
    The setting names may also be omitted, in which case only default constructor will be called and all the map keys
    are attempted to write on the target configuration object.
  </p>

  <h3 id="converter">Value conversion</h3>

  <p>
    In the previous example, the <em>timeout</em> is an <code>int</code> property of <code>AcmeDataSource</code>. There
    is built-in support most common Java types, where <code>String</code> is the source format. An empty source defaults
    to <code>null</code> value, no matter what the destination type is. The table below describes how the standard
    implementation of <a href="ws/rocket/config/section/value/ValueConverter.html">
    <code>ws.rocket.config.section.value.ValueConverter</code></a> called
    <a href="ws/rocket/config/section/value/DefaultConverter.html">
    <code>ws.rocket.config.section.value.DefaultConverter</code></a> works.
  </p>

  <h2 id="extending">Extending</h2>

  <p>This chapter gives a more detailed overview of how <em>Rocket-Config</em> works inside, its architecture, and how
    to extend built-in support.</p>

  <p>
    The central classes, <code>ConfigModel</code> and <code>MapConfigModel</code> set the general approach to defining
    configuration models and then parsing corresponding files. They cannot be extended, however, it is still possible to
    customize section parsing, writing section data (from the reader) to bean, and runtime value conversion from string.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>ConfigModel</code> class keeps information about sections using the
    <a href="ws/rocket/config/section/Section.html"><code>ws.rocket.config.section.Section</code></a> class. A
    <code>Section</code> has it's own name, reader, and writer instance. The model builder usually provides methods for
    constructing the readers and writers just by calling its methods. However, it also provides a method to define name,
    reader, and writer manually. Section readers and writers just need to implement
    <a href="ws/rocket/config/section/read/SectionReader.html">
    <code>ws.rocket.config.section.read.SectionReader</code></a> and
    <a href="ws/rocket/config/section/write/SectionWriter.html">
      <code>ws.rocket.config.section.write.SectionWriter</code></a> contracts correspondingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Runtime value parsers need to implement <code>ws.rocket.config.section.value.ValueConverter</code> contract. An
    instance of the custom converter must then be assigned to <code>ConfigModel</code> and/or
    <code>MapConfigModel</code> (in the <code>expect()</code> method) to be effective.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>StreamReader</strong> is the interface for objects taking care of section data lines. It needs to be
    implemented so that an instance could handle multiple sections in row. Initially, the reader object is called by
    the <code>readLine()</code> method per each section data row where comments have been removed (even empty lines
    trigger a call). When the data block completes, the <code>getResult()</code> method is called for results (might be
    called multiple times). To finally clean up, the <code>reset()</code> method is called to prepare for the next
    usage. Although the reader is invoked for each row, it is possible to create various section data format handlers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>StreamWriter</strong> interface, on the other hand, needs to take care of delivering the section reader
    result data to the target bean. It does not do it directly, but via <code>BeanWriter</code>, which takes care of the
    more technical part.
  </p>

  <h2 id="advice">Usage Advice</h2>

  <p>Here are some additional tips to avoid complicated scenarios:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Although default values are not explicitly, configuration beans should initialize them automatically, when
      appropriate. Think of how the configuration bean could be used programmatically to fine-tune the settings, how
      much can be assumed, and how little or much must be explicitly defined.
    </li>
    <li>
      When providing default values, also consider that default values should be omitted when <code>null</code> is also
      an acceptable value. Remember the <em>Rocket-Config</em> omits empty values, so existing values cannot be set to
      <code>null</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      It's best to avoid <strong>international characters</strong> in typical configuration file. However, when
      necessary, <em>Rocket-Config</em> supports <strong>UTF-8</strong> encoding of the stream.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you need to store user-interface texts and labels, remember that <code>java.util.Properties</code> is still
      the right tool for that.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Environment variables</strong> are not advisable nor supported in <em>Rocket-Config</em> parsed
      configuration files because they reduce predictability of deployment. If you still need to apply some values to
      variables in a configuration file, better create a script to replace the values in a configuration file template.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This is all for now. If you run into problems or feel uncertain on implementing your use cases, please <a
    href="https://github.com/mrtamm/rocket-config/issues/new" target="_blank">file an issue in the issue tracker</a>.
    Even if the problem turns out to not be a problem, the feedback can be used to fine-tune the implementation and/or
    this documentation. Therefore, all kind of feedback is welcome!
